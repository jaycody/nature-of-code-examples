###About SWIFT: 
- from [techcrunch article](http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apple-launches-swift-a-new-programming-language-for-writing-ios-and-os-x-apps/)

>
At its WWDC developer event today, Apple surprised all of the developers in the audience by launching a new programming language called Swift. This new language seems to be poised to replace Objective-C as the main programming language on Apple’s platforms.
>
Swift will use the same LLVM compiler and runtime as Apple’s Objective-C implementation, so Swift and Objective-C code can live side-by-side in the same application. The language provides access to all of the Cocoa and Cocoa Touch features developers are currently used to from Objective-C.
>
It should feel familiar to those who are already used to Objective-C, Apple says, and is meant to “unify the procedural and object-oriented portions of the language.” It does diverge from Objective-C in more than just the syntax, though; it also features variable types like tuples and optional types. It also includes operators that aren’t found in Objective-C, which allow you to perform remainder operations on floating-point numbers, for example.

###About PORTING: 
(as defined by wikipedia)
- The term "port" is derived from the Latin portare, meaning "to carry".  When code is not compatible with a particular operating system or architecture, the code must be "carried" to the new system.
- ...porting is the process of adapting software so that an executable program can be created for a computing environment that is different from the one for which it was originally designed (e.g. different CPU, operating system, or third party library).

###WHY?
- I was weeks away from switching to openFrameworks when Apple announced Swift at the WWDC.  My plan was to jump from Processing to openFrameworks by porting over my NOC inspired interactive particle system project immediately after breakdown of the version 6 installation scheduled for later this month (June 2014).  Since the next scheduled install isn't until Sept 2014, I'd have 3 months to convert to (aka LEARN) openFrameworks -- a conversion from which I was certain I would never return.  I was already saying my goodbyes to Processing.  
- and I've already spent considerable time working on and thinking about interactive versions of Shiffman's examples.  Most of my projects since leaving Shiffman's class at NYU involve modifying his code for use with Arduinos, Kinects, and TouchOSC based control devices.
- and I now have a couple of kids for whom I am fantastically excited about building interactive play spaces populated with autonomous characters capable of improvisational and life-like behavior.
- and what better way to learn SWIFT than by problem sets from NOC?  
- especially now as I prepare for a jump from building automated test frameworks in Python to developing interactive immersive experiences in SWIFT.

#####and a Thank you! Thank you! Thank You!
- to my wife and kids for their unwavering support and encouragement through the learning curve of code and career transition
- to Dan Shiffman for emphasizing the nature, not the code.
- to Red for knowing that if she built it, we would come.  
- to Dan O'Sullivan for demonstrating that Attention Deficit Hyperactivity is a superhero power - not a disorder
- to the collective effervescence of the 4th Floor for generating a perfect mix of meaning and novelty
- to the crew at Padopolis for showing me how the experts do things
- to Oak for believing in me, for giving me the opportunity, and for showing me the ropes.  

#####Sending out gratitude and love as I sit here at my desk in a Silicon Valley startup late into the night devising career strategies out of revisited grad school topics and modern programming languages while my encouraging family patiently waits for me at the other end of my commute.
