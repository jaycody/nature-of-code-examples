Chapter 4.  Particle Systems
----------------------------


Testing the function [function]*setup()* and the class PVector*.  Also here is a formula style (non mathml):

[formula]*y = sin(theta) `*` r*

And here is the style for something just monospaced:

[mono]*x: 5* + 
[mono]*y: 300*

[source,java]
----
// testing some code
int x = 100;
int y = 50;

void setup() {
  
}
