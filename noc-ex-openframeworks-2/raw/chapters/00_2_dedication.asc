She worked for Ramo-Wooldridge (now TRW) in Hawthorne and at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica with Richard Bellman and taught mathematics at the College of Notre Dame in Belmont, CA and at UCLA.  The Bella Manel Prize for outstanding graduate work by a woman or minority was established at NYU's Courant Institute in 1995.
